# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** November 27, 2025

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how the Smenarna Add-on ("we", "our", or "the Add-on") handles user information.

## Information Collection and Use

The Smenarna Add-on operates entirely within your Google Sheets environment and collects minimal information:

**What we collect:**
- Your email address (from your Google account) is recorded locally in your spreadsheet when you submit an order for audit trail purposes only

**What we don't collect:**
- We do not track user behavior or usage patterns beyond order submissions
- We do not store any data on external servers
- We do not share any information with third parties
- We do not transmit your email or any data outside your Google Workspace

## Data Processing

All data processing occurs locally within your Google Sheets document. The Add-on:
- Only accesses the spreadsheet data you explicitly authorize
- Processes data solely to provide the functionality of the Add-on
- Does not transmit data outside of your Google Workspace environment

## Permissions

The Add-on may request access to your Google Sheets to provide its functionality. These permissions are used exclusively to:
- Read and modify data within the active spreadsheet
- Display user interface elements
- Execute spreadsheet operations as requested by you

## Third-Party Services

The Add-on does not integrate with or transmit data to any third-party services, analytics platforms, or advertising networks.

## Data Security

Since we do not collect or store any user data, there is no data at risk. All operations are performed within the secure Google Workspace environment.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy.
